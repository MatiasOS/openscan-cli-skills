# OpenScan CLI

Query EVM and Bitcoin blockchain data. All output is JSON to stdout.

## How to Present Results

**IMPORTANT:** Never dump raw JSON to the user. Always interpret the data and provide human-readable insights tailored to the user's question.

### For `stats` results, always include:
- A plain-language summary answering the user's specific question
- Context on whether gas prices are low/normal/high (EVM: <10 gwei is low, 10-30 is normal, >30 is elevated, >100 is high)
- Block production health: are blocks recent? Is gas usage near limits?
- For Bitcoin: mempool congestion level, fee tier recommendations (use fast/medium/slow estimates)
- Any anomalies worth noting (sync issues, empty blocks, unusual gas patterns)

### For `debug-tx` results, always include:
- **Transaction summary**: What the transaction did (contract creation, token transfer, function call, etc.) in plain language
- **Success/failure verdict**: Clearly state whether the transaction succeeded or failed
- **If the transaction failed (`receipt.status === "reverted"`):**
  - Explain the `revertReason` in plain language (e.g., "The contract reverted with 'insufficient balance' — the sender tried to transfer more tokens than they held")
  - If the revert reason is a Panic code, explain what that panic means (e.g., Panic(0x11) = arithmetic overflow, Panic(0x01) = assertion failed, Panic(0x12) = division by zero, Panic(0x32) = array out of bounds)
  - Look at the `callTree` to identify which internal call reverted and explain the call chain that led to the failure
  - Check `stateChanges` to show what state was or wasn't modified before the revert
  - Suggest possible causes and fixes when the context makes it clear
- **Gas analysis**: Was gas efficiency reasonable? Did it run out of gas?
- **Key events emitted** (from `decodedEvents`): Summarize what happened on-chain
- **Decoded function call** (from `decodedInputData`): Explain what function was called with what parameters

## Example Insights

### Stats insight example
User asks: "What's gas like on Ethereum?"
After running the command, respond like:
> Gas on Ethereum is currently **12.3 gwei** — that's in the normal range. The base fee is 11.8 gwei with a 0.5 gwei priority tip. The latest block (#19,234,567) used 62% of its gas limit with 184 transactions, which suggests moderate activity. Good time to submit non-urgent transactions.

### Failed transaction insight example
User asks: "Why did this tx fail?"
After running the command, respond like:
> This transaction **reverted** with `Error("ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance")`.
>
> **What happened:** Address `0xAbC...` called `transfer(0xDeF..., 1000000000000000000)` on the USDC contract, attempting to send 1 USDC. However, the sender's balance was insufficient.
>
> **Call chain:** The top-level `transfer()` call delegated to an internal `_transfer()` which hit the balance check and reverted. No state changes were committed.
>
> **Gas:** 45,231 gas was used (60% of the 75,000 limit) before the revert.
>
> **Fix:** Ensure the sender has enough token balance before calling transfer, or add a balance check in your contract.

### Successful transaction insight example
User asks: "What happened in this tx?"
After running the command, respond like:
> This transaction **succeeded** — it was a `swap()` call on Uniswap V2 Router.
>
> **Action:** Swapped 0.5 ETH for ~1,234 USDC via the WETH/USDC pair.
>
> **Events:** 4 events emitted — `Transfer` (WETH deposit), `Sync` (pair reserves updated), `Swap` (actual swap), `Transfer` (USDC to recipient).
>
> **Gas:** Used 152,847 gas (76% of limit) at 15.2 gwei, costing ~0.0023 ETH ($4.12).

## Security

- **READ-ONLY** — no transaction signing, no private key handling
- Public RPCs only — no API keys needed by default
- Privacy-first RPC selection from metadata (tracking: "none")
